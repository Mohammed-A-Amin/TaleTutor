## üåü Inspiration

The inspiration for TaleTutor came from the desire to make learning more engaging and effective for students. Traditional educational methods often fail to connect topics holistically and relate concepts to real-world scenarios, leading to disinterest and fragmented understanding. Drawing from research on narrative learning and the transformative power of storytelling, we envisioned an AI-driven platform that uses immersive narratives to captivate students' imaginations. TaleTutor strives to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical applications, making education both fun and meaningful.

## üéì What It Does

TaleTutor is a narrative-based learning system that serves three primary purposes:
1. **Relating Material to Real-World Scenarios**: Connecting academic content with practical applications.
2. **Fostering Student Comfort**: Creating a comfortable and engaging learning environment.
3. **Making Learning Enjoyable**: Using immersive narratives to make education fun.

### Features

- **Dual Interfaces**: Separate interfaces for teachers and students.
- **Themed Learning**: Students can choose their learning theme, such as Harry Potter, with subjects like Physics and Civics.
- **Interactive Chat System**: A character-led interactive chat system that dynamically explains concepts based on student interaction.
- **Real-World Scenario Teaching**: Using fictional characters to teach real-world scenarios through engaging narratives.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

TaleTutor utilizes a LangChain-supported GPT-3.5 LLM to retrieve PDF content uploaded by teachers, convert it into a vectorstore, and perform RAG operations based on student queries. The system processes RAG output with another GPT-3.5 LLM that acts as a router, deciding whether to proceed with narrative building or knowledge retrieval. The GPT-3.5 LLM then generates narratives using zero-shot prompting. The system also manages off-topic queries by guiding students back on track or notifying teachers for relevant follow-up.
